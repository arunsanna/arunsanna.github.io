                    I'm a <span class="highlight">Chief Architect</span> and

                    Currently serving as Chief Architect at Allied Consultants, I combine deep expertise 
                    in application development, cloud infrastructure, DevSecOps automation, AI/ML systems, 
                    and data engineering to deliver comprehensive solutions. From building mobile apps to 
                    architecting enterprise-scale cloud platforms, I bring a full-spectrum approach to technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My diverse skill set enables me to architect end-to-end solutions: developing full-stack 
                    applications, implementing CI/CD pipelines, securing infrastructure with zero-trust 
                    architectures, integrating AI/ML capabilities, and building data platforms that process 
                    billions of records. This holistic expertise has been crucial in delivering mission-critical 
                    systems for government and enterprise clients.
